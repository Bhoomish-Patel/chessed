# Four Player Chess Game in Reactjs


### I am a chess fan who doesn't play good chess😅

Chess is 'generally' played by two people. But online chess has revolutionized the way we play chess. New varients of chess is trending. Chess is no more a game played only by two people with the 64 squares and traditional 6 types of chess pieces. It is more. And online chess and specially chess.com has made it possible.<br>
<br>
Now even four players can simultaneously play chess, either by one way or the other, like a hand and brain chess. But we also have a chess set in which four player can play chess. Here I 'will be trying' to build a four player chess set with all the chess rules.<br>
