# Four Player Chess Game in Reactjs
##### Under Development

### I am a chess fan who doesn't play good chess

Chess is 'generally' played by two people. But online chess has revolutionized the way we play chess. New varients of chess is trending. Chess is no more a game played only by two people with the 64 squares and traditional 6 types of chess pieces. It is more. And online chess and specially chess.com has made it possible.<br>
<br>
Now even four players can simultaneously play chess, either by one way or the other, like a hand and brain chess. But we also have a chess set in which four player can play chess. Here I 'will be trying' to build a four player chess set with all the chess rules.<br>
<br>
Will be fun to make and play this game(Inspiration taken from chess.com).<br>
